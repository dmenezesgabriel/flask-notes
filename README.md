# Flask Notes

Tell me what're thinking

## Description
---

The main tools I choosed to make it happen were:
- A python's micro web framework very well known called **Flask**;
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy** for ORM;
- A **PostgreSQL** relational database;
- **Bootstrap** to make things prettier;
- And all of this together on a **MVC** (model-view-controller) pattern

## Requirements
---
- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Docker-compose

## Reference
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
